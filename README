# Sukma's Dotfiles and Vim config

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but there are mine. This started around 2017 or so when I used lots of different machines and environments. Now I mostly use macOS and Linux, but still keep the environment in sync.

## Installation

1. `curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swardana/dotfiles/master/install.sh | bash`
2. `chsh` or otherwise set your shell to use http://www.zsh.org/
3. Restart your shell

Optionally create a `.postinstall` with some machine-specific commands, like `git config --global user.email "my-work-email@example.com"`". You can also create a `.vimlocal` and `.gvimlocal` for machine-specific Vim customizations.
